## 📊 Featured Project  
### 🛒 Zepto Pricing & Inventory Optimization  
Analyzed 3,700+ grocery SKUs to identify:
- Where inventory money is locked  
- Which products burn the most discount budget  
- Which SKUs should be prioritized for promotions  

**Key results:**  
- Total inventory value: **₹2.24M**  
- Top 10 products hold only **6.1%** of inventory (low risk)  
- Cooking oils & ghee are the biggest revenue levers
